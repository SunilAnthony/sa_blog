### ABOUT ME

Hi, I am Sunil Anthony. I'm a .NET full-stack developer specializing in Web technologies based in the Orlando Metro area. I started my career as <b>Help Desk Techincian</b> and later become a <b>Network and Systems Administrator</b> with over fifteen years of experience. Looking for a more challenging career, I decided to dive into the .NET world with C# and the rest was history. I love being a full-stack developer, the reward  of building an application and seeing it comes alive is overwhelming. 

I'm currently working as a full time Junior software developer with <b>My Florida Regional Multi Listing Services</b> where I enjoy building Web API, Web Systems, Windows Services, Standalone Web Forms application and many other tasks. I continue to grow and advance my career as a full-stack
developer by continue learning new technologies and frameworks such as Angular, Vue, .NET Core 2.0 and etc.  I'm also quite fond of the Python programming language and practice it in my free time.
